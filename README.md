Shopping Cart & Orders
is a marketplace that operates with different sellers that offer their products to be sold from X. 
This implies that a product can be sold by one or several sellers at different prices. 
Therefore, in our system we have to trace the selection of the product-seller once the user adds a product to the Shopping Cart and once the transaction ends.
## Implement Shopping Cart API:
- Add/Delete Seller
- Add/Delete Products linked to Seller
- Add/Delete products  to cart
- Get the total amount of the cart.
- Increase / Decrease the number of units of a product (0 means deleted).
- Remove a product from the cart
- Delete the entire cart
- Confirm Cart -> commit to buy.
## Example Workflow:
Elaborate a working set of example requests to fulfill a full buying process. User is Unique.
Do not forget Readme with a working example and environment setup.
Take care along the developing process (commits).
## Delivery
Right here!!!
Estimated completion time: 2 day.
The implementation of the exercise is free.
The details of implementation and the approach taken will be evaluated.
It is not necessary to develop a graphical interface.
